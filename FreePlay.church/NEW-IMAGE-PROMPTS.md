```
Professional infographic-style split image for church tech comparison. LEFT SIDE: Isometric illustration of cluttered tech setup - tangled cables, laptop, projector, frustrated stick figure teacher with question marks overhead, DVDs scattered. Red X icons.

RIGHT SIDE: Clean isometric illustration of simple TV on wall, single remote, happy stick figure teacher with checkmark overhead, kids watching contentedly.

- Clear visual contrast

- Brand colors
- No AI-generated faces

## Notes:
- **CRITICAL: Children must ALWAYS be in soft-focus background (bokeh effect)** - faces and details blurred for privacy and professional aesthetic
- All images should avoid "stock photo smile" look
- Use "documentary style" and "candid" to get more natural expressions
- Specify camera equipment and settings for photorealistic results
- Include "natural imperfections" to avoid AI-generated smoothness
- Use specific clothing details (volunteer badges, church t-shirts) for authenticity
- Wide aperture settings (f/1.8-f/2.8) to create that beautiful bokeh background effect
- Focus should be on: TV screens, products, teacher/volunteers - NOT on children's faces
