## Analysis After 33 Days

### What's Working ✓
1. **Strong presence in general church software searches** - B1 consistently ranks at or near #1
2. **Brand recognition stable** - B1.church and ChurchApps both appear in brand searches
3. **Accurate descriptions** - AI correctly describes B1 as "100% free, forever free"

### Persistent Gaps ⚠️
1. **Planning Center alternative searches** - Still not appearing despite comparison page
2. **Giving-specific searches** - Still not appearing despite free giving feature
3. **Third-party reviews** - No improvement; still no reviews on major platforms

### Recommendations

**High Priority:**
1. **Get reviews on SourceForge, G2, Capterra** - The lack of third-party reviews may be limiting visibility in comparison searches
2. **Optimize comparison pages for SEO/LLM** - The b1.church/compare/planning-center page exists but isn't surfacing
3. **Consider giving-specific content** - Create dedicated content about "free church giving with no platform fees"

**Monitor:**
1. Continue monthly checks to track any changes
2. Check if llms.txt is being indexed/referenced by AI systems
3. Watch for any drops in the queries where B1 currently ranks well
