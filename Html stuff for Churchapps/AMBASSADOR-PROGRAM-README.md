## The Complete Vision

## The Problem We're Solving

Churches worldwide face a common challenge: expensive church management software that drains budgets meant for ministry.

**The typical scenario:**
- Small to mid-sized churches pay $200-500/month for basic church management software
- That's $2,400-6,000 per year that could fund:
  - Food banks feeding families
  - Youth programs reaching teens
  - Mission work spreading the gospel
  - Community outreach serving neighborhoods
  - Pastoral care supporting members

**The compounding issue:**
- Many churches don't even know free alternatives exist
- They assume "you get what you pay for"
- Without local guidance, they struggle to implement new tools
- Tech support feels impersonal and disconnected from ministry context

---

## Our Solution: A Global Network of Local Champions

The ChurchApps Ambassador Program creates a worldwide network of church leaders who serve as regional advocates for free, open-source church technology.

### The Core Idea

**Instead of churches discovering us through ads or cold outreach, they learn from a trusted local leader in their community who:**
- Speaks their language (literally and culturally)
- Understands their specific context
- Provides hands-on, personal guidance
- Builds ongoing relationships
- Creates local support networks

### What Makes This Different

**Traditional model:**
- Company → Marketing → Church discovers product → Struggles alone to implement

**Ambassador model:**
- Local leader → Personal relationship → Church learns from trusted source → Gets ongoing local support → Joins regional community

## What Ambassadors Actually Do

### Minimum Commitment: One Activity Per Quarter

That's it. Just four activities per year. Each ambassador chooses what works for their region:

**Examples of quarterly activities:**
- Coffee with 3 local church leaders to share tools
- Training session at a host church (10-20 attendees)
- Virtual webinar for regional churches
- One-on-one implementation help with a specific church
- Create localized content (blog post, video) for their region
- Attend/speak at regional church conferences
- Host a "ChurchApps Demo Day" open house

**The key:** It's flexible, volunteer-based, and respects that these are busy church leaders with full-time ministry responsibilities.

### What Ambassadors DON'T Do

- They don't charge churches (everything stays free)
- They don't provide 24/7 tech support (we handle that centrally)
- They don't have sales quotas or metrics to hit
- They don't need to be software developers or tech experts
- They're not employees (purely volunteer advocates)

## Join the Mission

**We're building something bigger than a software program.**

We're creating a global movement of church leaders who believe that technology should serve the church, not burden it. That local relationships matter more than polished marketing. That churches thrive when they invest in ministry, not software licenses.
