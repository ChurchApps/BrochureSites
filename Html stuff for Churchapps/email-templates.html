                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Choose your communication platform (WhatsApp, Facebook Group, Discord, etc.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Invite 5-10 people to join your group</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Host your first meeting (virtual or in-person)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep it simple: introductions, share experiences, identify needs</li>
                            <li>Take a photo and share it in the Ambassador Facebook group!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>"Focus on helping, not teaching - ask what people need, then figure it out together"</li>
                    <li>"Take photos at every meeting - they're gold for quarterly reports"</li>
                    <li>"Don't try to be the expert - you're the connector"</li>

                <p>Hi <span class="variable">{FIRST_NAME}</span>,</p>

                <p>Your quarterly ChurchApps Ambassador report is due on <strong><span class="variable">{DUE_DATE}</span></strong> (2 weeks from today).</p>

                <p><strong>This is super simple - takes about 10-15 minutes!</strong></p>

                <p><strong>What we're asking for:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How many meetings/events did you host? (Even if it's zero, that's okay!)</li>
                    <li>How many churches did you help?</li>
                    <li>What's one surprising thing you learned?</li>
                    <li>What's one challenge you faced?</li>
                    <li>What's one need you're seeing in your region?</li>
                    <li>Optional: Photos, testimonials, or stories to share</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Why we ask for this:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay connected with what's happening in your region</li>
                    <li>Learn what features/resources churches need most</li>

                    <li>Identify where we can better support you</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Heads up:</strong> Missing 2 consecutive quarterly reports will pause your ambassador status, so please don't skip it!</p>
