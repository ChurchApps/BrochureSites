        <h2>1. Our Shared Mission</h2>
        <p>ChurchApps exists to lower barriers so churches can focus on people, not software. As an Ambassador, you join a global network committed to:</p>

            <li>Helping churches discover and adopt free, open-source ministry tools</li>
            <li>Providing local, peer-to-peer support and learning communities</li>
            <li>Sharing feedback and needs with the ChurchApps core development team</li>
            <li>Building a culture of collaboration, generosity, and contribution</li>
            <li>Never charging churches for help, training, or support</li>
        </ul>
